## Help getting started

If you want to see a full-featured example Zsh configuration using antidote, you can have a look at the [zdotdir](https://github.com/getantidote/zdotdir) project. Feel free to incorporate code or plugins from it into your own dotfiles, or you can fork it to get started building your own Zsh config from scratch driven by antidote.
