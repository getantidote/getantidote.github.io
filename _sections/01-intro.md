[Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) is a Zsh plugin manager made from the
ground up thinking about performance.

It is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static
plugin file that you can include in your Zsh config.

It is written natively in Zsh, is well tested, and picks up where
[Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) left off.
