Antidote is a Zsh plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.

It is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static
plugin file that you can easily load from your Zsh config.

It is written natively in Zsh, is well tested, and picks up where
[Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) left off.
