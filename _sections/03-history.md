**The short version:**

The original [Antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) plugin manager was slow.
[Antibody](https://github.com/getantibody/antibody) was written to address this, but was written in [Go](https://go.dev), not [Zsh](https://www.zsh.org).
Other native Zsh plugin managers caught up on speed, so it was deprecated.
But Antibody had some nice features that aren't in other Zsh plugin managers.
So [Antidote](https://github.com/mattmc3/antidote) was created to carry on as the next generation of antigen-compatible Zsh plugin managers.
